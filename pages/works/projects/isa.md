## ISA my second mobile application
This project started as a challenge from my Big Brother Allen. He saw my first flutter
application __Nuod__ which does nothing other than searching and selecting
movies so it can give you a random movie to watch.

So He ask me "Hey brother I got a challenge for you"

"Really? What is it, Brother?"

"We need some survey application where one of our employee can record the
customer's contact information and the item they are looking for that we currently
don't have in our store, so the app will save those items and it can send a
list of items filtered by date via email in spreadsheet format"

so I said "Okay Brathaa, I'll take the challenge just give me one week"

Now to give you a context, I'm relatively new to flutter, Yes I've developed an
application with it but I'm only using it for a couple of days so I say what
the heck I got nothing to lose and I love challenges so I took it and I took it
with passion! so I said **just give one week** to deliver the app

To be honest I'm a bit scared that I might fail Big Brother Allen for not
delivering the app on time.

However, each day pass by is like each day of a breakthrough for me!

On the first day, I started the design

The second day I keep designing

The third day I procrastinate and watch flutter tutorials in youtube

The fourth day I've setup my development environment and imported all the assets
needed on my flutter app then I started to write my widgets but mostly layout
related ones such as (header, buttons, etc...)

The fifth day is where most unknown things needed to be discovered so I have to
stop and do my research like "How to send email via flutter?" and "How to
convert sqflite data to .csv?"

The sixth day I get back into coding and implemented the solutions I've discovered
(thanks to stackoverflow)

and on the seventh day I'm so happy I made it this far, even though my app has bugs
I think it's now time to show it to my brathaa

So I contacted him in messenger and sent him a demo video

but then things immediately have changed and he is asking me to add some features now

It suddenly feels like a job to me instead of a side hustle that I'm willing to
do for free just for fun and to learn more about Flutter

But he is my brother and I love him so I have to do these features anyways and fix
these freaking bugs!

## Takeaways
I like developing apps with Flutter (until it became a job)
