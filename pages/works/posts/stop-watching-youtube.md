Stop watching youtube videos if it didn't meet the following cases:

- Watch news about global crisis
- Watch news about local crisis
- Someone really important to you told you so
- You need it for your work
- You need to study very quickly
- You need to get a very important video reference
- You are looking for answers and you can't find them from books and blog posts
- You want to relax for the entire day because you've been busting your ass off since the last 4 weeks
