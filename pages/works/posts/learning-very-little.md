Learning sucks! at least that is what I thought before I droppped out in
high school.

Here is what I remembered in learning during my tough times in life.

In learning you will experience active living.

In learning you will experience revelations and wonders.

In learning you will make a ton of mistakes or maybe we can call this as learning naturally.

In learning you will be humbled down for how much little you know about the
universe, and it's good.

Because then you will realize that you are not important at all, and it's good.

You will ask questions and no one will ever give you the most accurate answers
you are loking for, and again it's good.

Then you might go and seek out God for wisdom, and maybe ask him your questions
too. And that's fine,

Because no matter you despise or look at him based on everything that happens in
your life try to keep on good terms with him and keep learning.

It is wonderful knowing how much little we know and knowing it urge us to keep
living to know more.
