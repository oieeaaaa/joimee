[//]: # (What are the five hard-lessons that I've learned in my 3 years+ of coding experience)

We are taught—mostly in schools—that when we want to learn a certain skill or
profession, we need to follow a set of steps or instructions to learn that
skill.

This is true, believe me—no don't, I'm being sarcastic.

Now that the internet and the web exists, our bounderies to learn have vanished
in the abyss. It's now easy to say "I want to learn this thing" then find your
way to learn that thing. Save your time from going through the three sacred
level of steps that some schools tells you to follow before you can learn a
skill, have a job, and live a happy life—stop waiting for that rolled piece of
paper—you'll never learn to swim without jumping to the swimming pool—Dive!

I guess this lesson also applies to every field though I encountered it mostly
during my early days adulting. When I was looking for something exciting,
challenging, and keep my brain active and fat. I found coding!—I'm in love at first sight.

I hate my current Job at that time, don't have anything to lose, and I'm young,
so I said "What the heck, I wanna give it a shot.", I've pulled up my browser
and started googling.

## The beginning will be difficult

At first, I'm not sure if what I was doing is right—if coding is right for
me—or if I can find a job in this field without having a college degree.

The doubt started to creep in inside me whispering "Joimeeee... you suck at
coding, you'll never learn it." multiple times. Let me tell you that when you
are learning alone, didn't have friends/family that you can talk to about your
hardships in coding?—this agonizing experience will last in your head for weeks
or maybe even months if you're weak.

At some point, You will feel intimidated—so don't look up searching for that
checkered black-and-white flag—just focus on each step and progress that you've
made. Have a moment to enjoy and celebrate your little achievements.

You need to memember the lessons, hacks, and the techniques that you've learned
from other people or from your own experiences—these are the true rewards of
your effort.

Despite not attending college and being an autonomous young adult—I managed to
learn to code—with my HP Probook 4520s laptop—in my little apartment, while
working as an all-around-assitant for an Entrepreneur in Los Baños, Laguna.
Yeah I've finally learned how to write codes and build some simple stuff like a
website and get paid I believe that you can do it too.

I'm determined to do anything to learn programming—pirated udemy
courses—invested thousand of hours reading tutorials in w3schools, MDN, and
articles in Medium—asked a ton of silly questions—attended a coding bootcamp
knowing that I can't pay the whole fee.

## Focus on concepts, practices, and principles

...

## Don't be a Programmer Ninja

You will get confused when you compare your code to others

I remember, when I first started learning my for-loops in javascript, I spent
hours of time searching to find the meaning of `i` and `j` that experienced
programmer used on their code.

[//]: # (FACE PALM)

I want to be different, so I started putting `x` and `y` in my for-loops.

[//]: # (CODE EXAMPLE)

It's going to be brutal—It's like that customer service guy/gal that hates the
job—you will need a few meta-skills—patience, courage, and a little bit of
faith—before you dive in.

## Choose the lightbulb path

I've learned this from a book __The laws of simplicity__ by Dr. John Maeda, among all of his laws:

1. Reduce
  - The simplest way to achieve simplicity is through thoughtful reduction.
1. Organize
  - Organization makes a system of many appear fewer.
1. Time
  - Savings in time feel like simplicity.
1. Learn
  - Knowledge makes everything simpler.
1. Difference
  - Simplicity and complexity need each other.
1. Context
  - What lies in the periphery of simplicity is definitely not peripheral.
1. Emotion
  - More emotions are better than less.
1. Trust
  - In simplicity we trust.
1. Failure
  - Some things can never be made simple.
1. The One
  - Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious, and adding the meaningful.

Context is where I've learned the lesson to choose the lightbulb path.


## Coding is more than just a day-job


When you are alone right now, have no money, and know that something like
coding maybe your last resort to make something meaningful?—I say __Carpe Diem!__.
