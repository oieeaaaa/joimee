The average is for losers!

Oh, These odd things. Is this why we are here for? to try and
experience the new things in life to live to the fullest (well, maybe).

I once said this to a friend of mine and his response was, "let's do drugs,
live to the fullest pala ha?" didn't expect his response and I just laugh it out loud in front of our colleagues.

Some people want to stay in their habitat and lurk and some of us are sick of being anyone and wanted to try
something different.

So, whenever you encounter your crossroads in life sometimes try to pick the
unorthodox path. It is very risky but it's fun and it is worth the risk, trust me I've been there.
