On my first day as a lens-keeper, it was difficult.

When I hear one of my co-workers ask Me to get the lens and hand it to 'em.

It was difficult because they will speak in codes that I'm not yet familiar with.

E.g.,

Salesguy: Can you please get me (MC, TRG, PLANO, etc...)?

Me (deep inside): What the hell is he talking about?

I feel so stupid not knowing what they are talking about and communication is
crucial in my job.

So I have to study their language and catch up.

But looking back, I only remember the lessons I've learned from them, whenever
you see someone new in the environment you're working on. Stop using your
codes!!! Please... It's not clear what you are talking about.

If you intend to communicate better then speak some freakin basic
language and or at least explain what do you mean. Otherwise, you will sound
like rude or rather condescending.

Speaking codes are good only if the person who you are talking to speaks the same
codes as you. But good communication requires clarity of meaning and one of
the important things to maintain a good relationship is good communication.

My previous CEO, a good teacher, and a friend taught me.

By the way here is the meaning of each code mentioned above.

1. MC -> Multi-coated
1. TRG -> Transition gray
1. PLANO -> 0/0 grade
