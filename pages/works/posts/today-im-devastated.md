Today, I received a message from my client that they can't pay for the project in
which I've been working on for 2 months.

All the hard-work, sleeplessness nights, and liters of caffeine I've invested
on the project are meant for nothing (maybe).

You can't blame my client, I mean... It's my fault for not communicating well
of how much the project would cost at the end before I drowned myself in
coding and designing the project almost every day for 2 months.

All I can do right now is to accept the fact that I've made another huge
mistake in my life, and it will be a remarkable one—so I will never forget it.

It's freakin' tormenting. Coding, designing, and doing all these stuff for
someone and not receive any rewards (money I mean) at the end of all of your
hard-work.

I'm devasted and I'm broke. Sorry, Mom.

On a positive note—I learned, I still love coding, and I can finally sleep!
