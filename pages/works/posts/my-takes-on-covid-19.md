It is really frustating just thinking about the effect of The Novel Coronavirus to
our daily basis. People panicked, moving in to travel hastily, and acquire
as much goods as possible. Last night I read the entire article from wikipedia
about Covid-19 here in my country (Philippines).

> To me, this is a great experiment going on in real time. Can the world say to itself, ‘We have a common enemy. That enemy is not each other. The enemy is this invader to our species. It’s a virus.’ All the other reasons we would find to kill each other, because of skin color or who we worship or what line in the sand you happen to live on, across whatever line you live on, all these differences really look petty compared with confronting a common viral enemy.

- Neil DeGrasse Tyson

The fear that this virus cause to the mind is very depressing. I see people
getting paranoid I see someone panicking I see someone who doesn't care or maybe
does not want to care what is going on around Her. This pandemic is driving
us to be more united
