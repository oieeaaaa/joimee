That is the question.

You've come a long way

You've watched a lot of how to's tutorial

You've asked for others advice

And you think you are ready.

But when and where should you start?

## For me, it all started here

At the very stage of my career, I was forced by nature to work, drop out in high
school, and face the challenges that I know will come along the journey and I
was just terribly scared by these because I know once I started there is no
re-spawn, nor turning back. Unlike what I learned from the game of DOTA when
your character died you get to re-spawn and continue the game but now that I
have to face the depths and misery of life I need to properly play this game and
have faith not to die along the way.

So that being said, it is how I started (in a lot of things).

## It's like a race, you know?

Many times we will put on places like there is no other way than moving forward

You don't have so much time to assimilate the situation and think

You don't have so many options to compare for and pick

And sometimes all you need to do is to allow the subconscious mind to start your race.

I like to end this post with a quote from Napoleon Hill.

> The subconscious mind makes no distinction between constructive and destructive thought impulses. It works with the material we feed it, through our thought impulses. The subconscious mind will translate into reality a thought driven by fear, just as readily as it will translate into reality a thought driven by courage or faith.
