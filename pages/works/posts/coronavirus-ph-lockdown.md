I've been working from home for about a month now after our company's President
declared on March 12, that we need to work from home for more or less 4 weeks

Later that day, I immediately pack my things up and travel back from Pasig Metro Manila
to Isabela

Now, I'm here at home trying not to panic, trying to educate myself about the virus
trying to take a bath for at least twice a day now, trying to not to touch my
face, trying a lot of things to get entertained when boredom kicks in, and at
the very least trying to try something new and maximize the time while at home

Ohhhh I miss the office, I miss playing ping-pong, I miss having fun at lunch
with my colleagues, and most of all I miss the free breakfast on Mondays.

What I don't miss is the building. Yeah, the building that almost got me killed
twice, the building that will decide whether you will live or not once you ride one of
their elevators, the building that had a funny smell on the 11th floor when some other folk leave
the public restroom open.

However, I'm so glad we have moved to a new office now, Yeah we moved but same
building just 1 floor up from the previous one a bit far from the smell we got
from the 11th floor's public restroom but the same freakin elevators.

Going back to the virus it is tormenting just thinking about the lives of many many many infected
people out there who some of them may not have enough resources or may not have
someone to take care of them

On the other point of view, it is nice to see people uniting, protecting and loving
each other during this very moment

This is the cure not for the virus, but for its effect that implicates fear

Right now, I'm taking this as an opportunity to grow and to improve.

If you need to learn the information you need is in your smartphone all you
need is the internet and everything beyond that is in your hands.

Remember, You are still in control so don't panic.
